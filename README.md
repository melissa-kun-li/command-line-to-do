## Simple command line to-do list manager
This command line program keeps a to-do list of tasks and has save/load functionality by writing tasks to a txt file. The txt file is read when the program starts so that tasks are saved from the previous session.  

Its features are:
1. Create a task (name and description)
2. List all tasks from to-do list
3. Remove a task from to-do list
4. Update a task
5. Exit

### Next steps:
Add feature to create a new user and allow multiple users to have their own to-do lists, maybe with authentication
Create a web app/Flask app
Use sqlite to store tasks in to-do list
